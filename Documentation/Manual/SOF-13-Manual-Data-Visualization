# Data-logging using ROS bag

## Create plots

Run local_setup.bash?

. install/local_setup.bash

Run the following command to start the visualisation script and create the plots.

ros2 run subplots subplots

As soon as a message is published onto one of the topics subscribed to the data should show up on the corresponding plot.

## Note

The GPS plot never resets, which means a restart is required to clear the plot.
The velocity prints the 20 latest velocities and all the polar plots plot the current value.
