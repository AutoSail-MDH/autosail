# Data-logging using ROS bag

> Note that this guide will only initiate plots and wait for topics GPS, IMU, VELOCITY to be launched, once topics are launched plots will begin

## Prerequisites

cd AutoSail-HT21/ROS2/visualisation/

pip install -r requirements.txt


To install BaseMap, follow this guide:

https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html

OR
1. Download: https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap/releases/
cd to-downloaded-directory
unzip basemap
cd geos-X-X-X
export GEOS_DIR=/usr/local
sudo python setup.py install


## Create plots

colcon build --packages-select subplots

. install/local_setup.bash

Run the following command to start the visualisation script and create the plots.

ros2 run subplots subplots

As soon as a message is published onto one of the topics subscribed to the data should show up on the corresponding plot.

## Note

The GPS plot never resets, which means a restart is required to clear the plot.
The velocity prints the 20 latest velocities and all the polar plots plot the current value.
