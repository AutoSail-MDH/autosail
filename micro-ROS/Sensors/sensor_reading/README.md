# Data acquisition

This application bundles together three submodules, [GPS](https://github.com/AutoSail-MDH/AutoSail-HT21/tree/main/micro-ROS/Sensors/gps), [Vessel orientation](https://github.com/AutoSail-MDH/AutoSail-HT21/tree/main/micro-ROS/Sensors/vessel_orientation) and [Wind direction](https://github.com/AutoSail-MDH/AutoSail-HT21/tree/main/micro-ROS/Sensors/wind_direction). This is so all three can be ran on one MCU, instead of on seperate ones. See each seperate submodule for information on how to run them seperate.
